/* 
Static properties and methods are properties and methods that are shared by all instances of the class.
Static properties and methods are defined on the class itself, not on the instances of the class.
Static properties and methods are not accessible from the instances of the class.
Static properties and methods are accessible from the class itself.


What is Instance?
Instance is an object that is created from a class.


what is the difference between static and instance properties?
Static properties are defined on the class itself, not on the instances of the class.
Instance properties are defined on the instances of the class.

// Static methods are useful when you want to perform operations that are not specific to any instance of the class.
// For example, you can use a static method to calculate the average of a set of numbers.

// Inbuild static methods  - These are the methods that are built into the language and are available on the class itself.

Math.PI // => static property or static field

Math.random() // => static method

// Array
Array.isArray() // check if it is array

// Number
Number.isNaN() // check Number is not a number(NaN)

// Object
Object.keys({}) // Returns an array of the object's own enumerable property keys.

// String
String.fromCharCode(65, 78, 66, 85) // converts Unicode values to characters (ANBU).




// Static properties and methods are useful when you want to keep track of the total number of instances of a class.
// For example, you can use a static property to keep track of the total number of instances of a class.
