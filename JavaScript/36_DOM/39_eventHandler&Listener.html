<!-- 39. EVENT HANDLER AND EVENT LISTENER:

Event Handler: This is the process of handling the events of the element.

Event Listener: This is the process of listening to the events of the element.

Difference between Event Handler and Event Listener:
- Event Handler is used to call the function when the event is triggered.
- Event Listener is used to listen to the event and call the function when the event is triggered. -->

    <!-- onclick() is used to call the function firstHandler() and secondHandler() when the button is clicked. 
    But we can only call one function at a time. It will not call both functions. 
    It will return the output of the first function called. -->
    <!-- <button id="handler" onclick="firstHandler()" onclick="secondHandler()"> Handler </button> -->


    <!-- This is the button that will be used to call the function firstHandler() and secondHandler() when the button is clicked.
    It will the function secondHandler() when the button is clicked.
    because both events are overridden. First DOM will consider the firstHandler() and then it will consider the secondHandler() and firstHandler() will be ignored. -->
